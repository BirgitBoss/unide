We're happy to announce, that the proposal for our new Eclipse Project is online! You can find it at [https://projects.eclipse.org/proposals/unide](https://projects.eclipse.org/proposals/unide). For further discussions, there's the [forum post](https://www.eclipse.org/forums/index.php/t/1080186/) as well.
Now, it's time to study all details about Eclipse processes and [license regulations](https://eclipse.org/legal/eplfaq.php#3RDPARTY).
