Weâ€™re happy to announce, that the process message specification is online! You can find it at [http://www.eclipse.org/unide/specification](http://www.eclipse.org/unide/specification). With this type of messages you have a standard format for sending data out of discrete and possibly complex processes. ![alt text](/unide/images/processPayload.png)
