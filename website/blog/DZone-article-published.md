A new article about PPMP and the Eclipse Unide project was published at [DZone](https://dzone.com/articles/eclipse-unide-a-way-to-establish-an-open-industry)!
It explains how to use the [PPMP validator](https://www.eclipse.org/unide/2017/06/29/Validator-Online/), gives an overview of the InfluxDB / Grafana visualisation and how this setup can be used in an Eclipse Testbed.
