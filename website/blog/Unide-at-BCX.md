Unide and PPMP were used in <a href="http://bcw.bosch-si.com/berlin/bcw-hackathon/?refresh=1">Bosch Connected Experience Hackaton</a> by students and developers to connect sensors to backend solutions in just two days!
They even took a professional video:

Also in the same conference, Bosch CEO Dr. Volkmar Denner <a href="http://bcw.bosch-si.com/berlin/bcw-hackathon/?refresh=1">refered to PPMP again</a>:
<blockquote>
	<p>On a more practical level, the product performance management protocol, or PPMP, is being tried out at the Bosch plant in Homburg, Germany, as part of a joint Industrie 4.0 and IIC testbed. Bosch itself developed the PPMP, which is available to all at no cost. It allows small and medium-sized enterprises to transmit data from their sensors quickly, simply, and securely to the production systems of large companies. This helps remove some of the obstacles preventing entry into connected manufacturing. This first practical experience will be used to further refine the new protocol â€“ work which will be done by Eclipse, an open-source community. Once again, we see that openness is our life blood.</p>
