Unide proposal has been approved to be an Eclipse Project! You can now find all relevant information at [https://projects.eclipse.org/projects/iot.unide](https://projects.eclipse.org/projects/iot.unide).

There's still some paperwork pending, but it looks promising! Next steps are
* creating a proper homepage with relevant information and the PPMP specification
* license checking of initial commitment code.
* getting in touch with Eclipse community
* making plans for the upcoming months
