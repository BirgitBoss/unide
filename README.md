[Eclipse Unide](https://www.eclipse.org/unide) publishes the current version of Production Performance Management Protocol (PPMP) and develops simple server/client implementations. The implementations store the payloads in a database and displays them through a simple user interface. Everyone can then use these samples for their custom condition monitoring applications.

# Getting started

For installing the Unide server and binding implementations use Maven.

## Installation

Run `mvn clean install`
