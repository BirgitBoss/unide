[Eclipse Unide](https://www.eclipse.org/unide/) publishes the current versions of Production Performance Management Protocol (PPMP) and wants to provide simple client/server implementations. The implementations shall help to validate PPMP-payloads versus the given specifications and allow to store data in a database.

## Getting Started

You can use the current implementations for checking if you PPMP implementations are valid to the PPMP-specification.

## Components

Unide at the moment consists of a Java binding and REST-server which can be use as validator for PPMP messages.
